1
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,068
Thanks.

2
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:14,746
No.

3
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,835
Hands up. Hands up!

4
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

5
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:25,507
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

6
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,468
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

7
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,678
How else do you think
I got in here?

8
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,597
What's your name again?

9
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,391
It's Jim Hopper.

10
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,184
Chief Jim Hopper.

11
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,144
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper...

12
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,189
<i>Come again?</i>

13
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,445
Hey...

14
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:49,030
you mind if I borrow this one?

15
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,419
Drink.

16
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:03,795
It'll calm your nerves.

17
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,132
Help you think straight, yeah?

18
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:13,763
I don't know what to do.

19
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,599
I know. I know.

20
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,270
This whole time...

21
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:25,650
I... I could... I could feel him.

22
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,985
He was...

23
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,071
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

24
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,907
I knew he was alive.

25
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:37,787
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

26
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,874
Now it's like I... uh...

27
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:45,170
God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

28
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,299
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

29
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,426
Like how everybody is looking at me.

30
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,428
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

31
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:57,390
You're not gonna like this,

32
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:01,102
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

33
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,481
It's in your head.

34
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,985
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

35
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,030
No, this is not that.

36
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,323
I mean, when something like this happens,

37
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:16,451
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

38
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,954
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

39
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,956
and you're saying his body is fake.

40
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,501
He's in the wall.

41
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,170
I mean, how do you explain that?

42
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,591
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

43
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:35,387
At least go talk to a shrink or...

44
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,515
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

45
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,475
Joyce, you just told me...

46
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,811
that Will is gone.

47
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:47,857
What else is there to do?

48
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:52,404
Hey.

49
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,169
Will?

50
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:10,630
Will?

51
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,300
Will?

52
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:17,470
Will?

53
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,285
What was Will saying?

54
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,579
Like home... Like home...

55
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,457
but dark?

56
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,792
And empty.

57
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:53,339
Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

58
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:56,509
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

59
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,011
It's like riddles in the dark.

60
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,971
Like home.
Like his house?

61
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:01,306
Or maybe like Hawkins.

62
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,932
Upside down.

63
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,268
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

64
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,895
- What?
- Upside down.

65
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:11,774
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

66
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,818
Upside down.

67
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:15,528
Dark. Empty.

68
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,447
Do you understand what he's talking about?

69
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,573
No.

70
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:19,949
Guys, come on, just think about it.

71
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,077
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

72
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:24,954
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

73
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,748
But what if he was there?

74
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,791
What if we just couldn't see him?

75
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,835
What if he was on the other side?

76
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:35,089
What if this is Hawkins and...

77
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:37,759
this is where Will is?

78
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:39,469
The Upside Down.

79
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:41,262
Like the Vale of Shadows.

80
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,641
Will?

81
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,228
Will?

82
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,607
Will?

83
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,291
I see him! Hey! Stop!

84
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,258
"The Vale of Shadows

85
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:22,595
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

86
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,646
<i>It is a place of decay and death."</i>

87
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,064
Will?

88
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:37,026
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

89
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,864
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

90
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,325
Will?

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,495
Will?

92
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,581
An alternate dimension.

93
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,500
But... how... how do we get there?

94
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,626
You cast Shadow Walk.

95
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,003
In real life, dummy.

96
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,088
We can't shadow walk, but...

97
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,465
maybe she can.

98
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,928
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

99
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:08,683
Oh, my God!

100
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,574
What the hell?

101
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,202
Hey!

102
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,287
Hey! Hey!

103
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:30,533
Hey, kid.

104
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,410
What's going on?

105
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:36,581
- Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
- On the couch.

106
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,708
Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

107
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,585
How are you holding up?

108
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,339
What happened?

109
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,049
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

110
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,762
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

111
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,556
Jonathan, that's enough.

112
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,059
Can we talk?

113
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,311
Alone?

114
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,355
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

115
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:03,024
We all are.

116
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:07,195
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

117
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,780
Yeah. Well, you being here,

118
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,072
you're just making things worse,
like always.

119
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:11,199
- Worse?
- Yeah!

120
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:13,242
She took down that wall with an ax.

121
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,411
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

122
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,996
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

123
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,831
This isn't some kind of joke.

124
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,917
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,376
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

126
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,712
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

127
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,963
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

128
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,548
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

129
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,009
You hear me?

130
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:35,389
Look, I'm on your side.

131
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:36,766
I'm here to help.

132
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:39,644
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

133
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,438
Thank God you're here.

134
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,734
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

135
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,487
If not for me, for your mother.

136
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:56,953
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

137
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,839
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

138
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,633
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

139
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:12,802
Looks good.

140
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,263
Here we go.

141
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,349
You look nice, sweetie.

142
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,687
Anything else?

143
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,647
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

144
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,566
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

145
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,943
I'm fine. Thanks.

146
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:56,637
Ugh.

147
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,237
Come on.
Time to go.

148
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,951
Come on.

149
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,915
<i>"Fear not,
for I am with you.</i>

150
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:26,667
<i>Be not dismayed, for I am your God.</i>

151
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:29,629
I will strengthen you.

152
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,881
Yes, I will help you.

153
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,635
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

154
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:40,097
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

155
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,726
How, if He is truly benevolent...

156
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:48,064
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

157
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,984
It would be easy to turn away from God...

158
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,321
but we must remember that nothing,

159
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:58,032
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

160
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:01,118
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

161
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,454
and to surround Will and his family...

162
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:06,874
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

163
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,096
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

164
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,264
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

165
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,392
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

166
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:27,645
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

167
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:30,231
Thanks for coming out.

168
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,285
I see Will the Wise is back.

169
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,915
What's that shooting out of his cane?

170
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,417
Fireballs.

171
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,794
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

172
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:52,920
Oh, well...

173
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:56,048
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

174
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:59,343
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

175
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,054
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

176
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:05,433
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

177
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,517
You know?

178
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,060
Yeah.

179
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,104
So he needs the fireballs?

180
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,982
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

181
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,484
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

182
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,987
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

183
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,990
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

184
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:13,769
<i>Will! Will, it's us!
Are you there?</i>

185
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,229
<i>Can you hear us?
We're here!</i>

186
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:17,606
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

187
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,526
<i>- Why can't he hear us?</i>
<i>- I don't know!</i>

188
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,903
<i>Mom, it's coming!</i>

189
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,198
She was there.

190
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,828
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

191
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:33,372
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

192
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:36,000
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

193
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,168
that's my house.

194
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,129
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

195
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,590
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

196
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:45,968
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

197
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:48,971
You want to go out there.

198
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:50,848
We might not find anything.

199
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,266
I found something.

200
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,147
And if we do see it...

201
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:02,276
then what?

202
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,072
We kill it.

203
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:12,369
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

204
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:22,546
Are you serious?

205
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,009
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

206
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,263
This is a terrible idea.

207
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:33,891
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

208
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,894
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

209
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:37,978
You know that.

210
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,313
Your mom would.

211
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:41,899
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

212
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,400
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

213
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,818
when this thing is dead.

214
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,450
I don't know what in the world caused it.

215
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,702
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

216
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,455
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

217
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:57,581
Mr. Clarke?

218
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,584
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

219
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:01,794
That right?

220
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:05,256
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

221
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,875
Mr. Clarke?

222
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,585
Oh, hey, there.

223
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,796
How are you boys holding up?

224
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:50,009
We're... in... mourning.

225
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,845
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

226
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:55,222
We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

227
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:58,475
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

228
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,478
So, you know how in <i>Cosmos,</i>
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?

229
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:02,688
Like, beyond our world?

230
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,273
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

231
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:05,441
Right, theoretically.

232
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:08,110
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

233
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:09,403
You guys have been thinking about

234
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,572
Hugh Everett's <i>Many-Worlds Interpretation,</i>
haven't you?

235
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:16,285
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

236
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:17,786
Just like our world,

237
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,331
but just infinite variations of it.

238
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,583
Which means there's a world out there

239
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,251
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

240
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,503
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

241
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,130
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

242
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:29,757
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

243
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,383
You know the Vale of Shadows?

244
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,886
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

245
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:34,970
Yeah, exactly.

246
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,431
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

247
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,849
how would we travel there?

248
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,809
- Theoretically.
- Well...

249
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:48,400
Picture... an acrobat...

250
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,819
standing on a tightrope.

251
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:53,530
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

252
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:56,075
And our dimension has rules.

253
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,994
You can move forwards, or backwards.

254
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,080
But, what if...

255
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:05,292
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

256
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,504
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

257
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,880
- Right?
- Right.

258
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:12,257
Here's where things
get really interesting.

259
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,635
The flea can also travel this way...

260
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,845
along the side of the rope.

261
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,555
He can even go...

262
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:20,724
underneath the rope.

263
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:23,018
- Upside down.
- Exactly.

264
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,354
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

265
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,689
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

266
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,400
So we can't go upside down?

267
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,818
No.

268
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,612
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

269
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,282
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

270
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,160
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

271
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:42,538
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

272
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,831
and then...

273
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,088
you create a doorway.

274
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,841
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

275
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,718
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

276
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,263
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

277
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,765
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

278
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:03,142
It would disrupt gravity,

279
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:05,185
the magnetic field, our environment.

280
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,688
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

281
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,482
Science is neat.

282
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,318
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

283
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,956
Whoa.

284
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,544
Hey, Chief!

285
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,255
- Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

286
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:37,551
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

287
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:41,305
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

288
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,809
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

289
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:48,562
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

290
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:49,688
and they didn't come back home.

291
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:54,276
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

292
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:58,572
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

293
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,282
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

294
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,284
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

295
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,244
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

296
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:05,829
Mirkwood.

297
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:07,164
What?

298
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:08,999
Okay.

299
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,793
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

300
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:14,546
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

301
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,091
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

302
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:21,094
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

303
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,722
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

304
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:26,850
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

305
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,729
Yeah.
It's funny.

306
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,861
Is he off his meds again?

307
00:22:37,945 --> 00:22:40,572
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

308
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:41,907
That's what I think.

309
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:51,041
What are you doing?

310
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:52,751
What does it look like I'm doing?

311
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,378
You want to freeze to death all winter?

312
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:01,593
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

313
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:04,054
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

314
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,395
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

315
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,272
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

316
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:15,065
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

317
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:17,192
I just wanted to look around, you know?

318
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,736
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

319
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:24,408
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

320
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,536
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

321
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:34,418
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

322
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:35,586
But that's got to be what happened.

323
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,715
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

324
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:42,676
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

325
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,513
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

326
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,564
Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

327
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:56,898
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

328
00:23:57,983 --> 00:23:59,901
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

329
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:02,279
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

330
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:09,369
What's exciting about this?

331
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:12,956
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

332
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,916
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

333
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,086
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

334
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,505
Are you both seriously this dense?

335
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:26,720
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

336
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:29,181
Which means that's true north.

337
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:30,974
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

338
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:34,519
Do you even understand
how a compass works?

339
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,855
- Do you see a battery pack in this?
- No.

340
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,940
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

341
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,818
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

342
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:43,320
So what's wrong with them?

343
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:45,405
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

344
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,532
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

345
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,993
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

346
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:51,787
the needle deflects to that power.

347
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,538
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

348
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,290
The gate would have so much power...

349
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:56,958
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

350
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,085
Exactly.

351
00:24:58,168 --> 00:25:00,545
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

352
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,589
They should lead us to the gate.

353
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,145
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

354
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:01,481
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

355
00:26:02,232 --> 00:26:05,152
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

356
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:06,611
What? No.

357
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,739
Oh, no, I was just...

358
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,576
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

359
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:14,536
Well, uh...

360
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:15,954
listen, I'm really sorry.

361
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:18,790
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

362
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,626
Okay.

363
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,211
I panicked and...

364
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:28,091
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

365
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,805
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

366
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:35,140
Totally, but...

367
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:37,392
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

368
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,311
Any news about Barbara?

369
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:43,356
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

370
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,527
Hey, listen.

371
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:50,614
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

372
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:53,366
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

373
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,243
<i>All The Right Moves</i> is still playing.

374
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,747
You know, with your lover boy
from <i>Risky Business?</i>

375
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,873
Yeah, I know.

376
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:01,625
You know, Carol thinks
I actually kinda look like him.

377
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,460

I just, I... I don't think I can.

381
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:17,224
I've been really busy
with this whole funeral thing and...

382
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,434
with my brother.

383
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,228
It's been really hard on him.

384
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:23,939
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

385
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,442
So...

386
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,154
I should go.

387
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:33,323
Sorry.

388
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:38,036
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?

389
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:42,791
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

- No!

393
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:05,564
The money!
Admit it!

394
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:09,234
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

395
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:12,571
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

396
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:15,198
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

397
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:17,534
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

398
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:20,287
Oh, like maybe
to pay off your debts?

399
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,706
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,916
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

401
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,002
- Lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you!

402
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,461
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

403
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:29,588
- Huh?
- What?

404
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:31,256
Where does Jonathan
want to go to college?

405
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,258
We get that money,
anywhere he damn well pleases!

406
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:35,093
NYU, Lonnie!

407
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:38,722
He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

408
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:41,099
So then he goes to NYU!

409
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,350
Get out.

410
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:44,895
Get out!

411
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:46,980
You need me here, Joyce.

412
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:50,734
Oh, brother,
I have not needed you for a long time!

413
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:53,069
Oh, no?
Look what happened.

414
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:57,324
Oh, don't you dare.

415
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,868
- At least I was here!
- Oh, come on, Joyce.

416
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,828
Just look around at this place.

417
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:03,288
All your Christmas lights.

418
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:06,458
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

419
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,753
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

420
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:14,841
But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

421
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:17,636
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

422
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:21,640
Now, get out!

423
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:23,808
Get out of my house!

424
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:38,949
You're supposed
to hit the cans, right?

425
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:44,162
No, actually, you see the spaces
in between the cans?

426
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,122
I'm aiming for those.

427
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,248
Ah.

428
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,086
You ever shot a gun before?

429
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,047
Have you met my parents?

430
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:57,008
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

431
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:00,512
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

432
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,347
He made me kill a rabbit.

433
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,224
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:08,019
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

435
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,438
I cried for a week.

436
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:11,690
Jesus.

437
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,067
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

438
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,404
I meant your dad.

439
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:18,697
Yeah.

440
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,742
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

441
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,162
...I wasn't around for that part.

442
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,708
Um, yeah.

443
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,253
Just, uh, point and shoot.

444
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:38,216
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

445
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,260
They must've married for some reason.

446
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:41,720
My mom was young.

447
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,180
My dad was older,

448
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:49,352
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

449
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:54,774
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

450
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:56,776
and started their nuclear family.

451
00:30:57,861 --> 00:30:59,696
Screw that.

452
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:00,947
Yeah.

453
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,575
Screw that.

454
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:18,089
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

455
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,675
<i>Jim?</i>

456
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,510
Yeah.

457
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:25,263
<i>Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.</i>

458
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,974
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

459
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:30,435
I just wanted to hear your voice and,
uh...

460
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,647
I just wanted to say that, um...

461
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,529
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

462
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:44,282
I don't regret any of it.

463
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:47,243
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

464
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:49,788
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

465
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:52,582
No.

466
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,835
No.

467
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,046
<i>Honey, hey...</i>

468
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,216
<i>Hey, it's okay...
it's okay.</i>

469
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,928
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

470
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:06,387
<i>Jim, I can't...</i>

471
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:08,556
Just take care of yourself, okay?

472
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,016
Say hi to Bill for me.

473
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,392
<i>Are you sure...</i>

474
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:40,255
How much further?

475
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:44,425
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

476
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,720
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

477
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,264
I'm just saying.

478
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,766
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

479
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,520
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

480
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,026
Do you think she's acting weird?

481
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:05,697
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

482
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,908
I mean, weirder than normal?

483
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:11,619
I don't know.
Who cares?

484
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:21,921
How far, Papa?

485
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,257
Farther than we've ever gone before.

486
00:33:29,012 --> 00:33:30,638
- The bath?
- Yes.

487
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:33,266
Yes, the bath.

488
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,062
Is that okay?

489
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:43,401
Okay.

490
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:13,574
Mike.

491
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,035
Yeah?

492
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,662
Turn back.

493
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,289
What? Why?

494
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:20,456
I'm tired.

495
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,335
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

496
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:44,147
You never said what I was saying.

497
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:46,649
What?

498
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:47,859
Yesterday.

499
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:51,446
You thought I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

500
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:52,697
Oh, uh...

501
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:54,866
I don't know.

502
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:58,536
My guess...

503
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:04,751
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

504
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,295
But for that moment...

505
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:09,839
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

506
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:12,300
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

507
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:18,097
That is such bullshit.

508
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,557
What?

509
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:23,269
I am not trying to be someone else.

510
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:25,855
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him...

511
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:28,608
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

512
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,651
He's actually a good guy.

513
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:31,819
Okay.

514
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:35,198
Yesterday, with the camera...

515
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,326
He's not like that at all.

516
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,703
He was just being protective.

517
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:42,622
Yeah, that's one word for it.

518
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:45,541
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

519
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,126
No, I... I never said that.

520
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,419
He had every right to be pissed...

521
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,546
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

522
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,048
No.

523
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:54,217
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

524
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,178
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

525
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:02,266
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

526
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,185
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

527
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:07,355
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

528
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:10,691
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

529
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,735
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

530
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:14,695
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

531
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,698
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

532
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,701
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

533
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,413
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

534
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,664
who now works sales,

535
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,583
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

536
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:31,003
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

537
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,089
but now, hey, they get it."

538
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,309
Go away, Lonnie.

539
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:49,313
Seriously!

540
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,275
I am gonna murd...

541
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,113
What? What?

542
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:09,292
Oh, Jesus.

543
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,807
Oh, no.

544
00:38:24,891 --> 00:38:27,685
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

545
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:29,228
- We're headed back home.
- What?

546
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:30,563
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

547
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:33,024
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

548
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,610
And you're just realizing this now?

549
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:38,613
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

550
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:40,198
What do yours say?

551
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:41,824
North.

552
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:44,368
Makes no damn sense.

553
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:46,412
Maybe the gate moved.

554
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:48,372
No, I don't think it's the gate.

555
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:51,292
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

556
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,127
Maybe it's something here.

557
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:55,630
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

558
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,381
It's not a magnet.

559
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:59,383
She's been acting weirder than normal.

560
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,303
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

561
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:03,429
Why would she do that?

562
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:05,473
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

563
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:06,891
Because she's a traitor!

564
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,937
Lucas, what are you doing?

565
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:14,899
You did it, didn't you?

566
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:16,776
You don't want us to reach the gate.

567
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,653
You don't want us to find Will.

568
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:19,862
Lucas, come on, seriously,

569
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,113
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

570
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:22,823
- No.
- Admit it!

571
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:26,994
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

572
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:30,164
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

573
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,041
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

574
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,211
Right, El?

575
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:39,882
It's... not...

576
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:43,511
it's not safe.

577
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:05,074
Okay.

578
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:06,742
Should be okay, I mean...

579
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,829
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

580
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:11,581
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

581
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,874
They bugged my place.

582
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,293
- What?
- They bugged my place.

583
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,837
They put a microphone in the light.

584
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,175
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

585
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,969
- I don't know...
- Who?

586
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:26,429
I thought they might be watching you, too.

587
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:29,765
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

588
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,018
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not...

589
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:35,146
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

590
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:37,648
What?

591
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:39,650
It wasn't him.

592
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:41,527
What?

593
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,738
Will's body, it was a fake.

594
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:52,413
You were right.

595
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:57,084
This whole time, you were right.

596
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,217
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

597
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:07,511
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

598
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:08,596
Find Will?

599
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,930
Find Will?

600
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:13,392
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

601
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:16,145
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

602
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:17,480
Just think about it, Mike.

603
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:20,274
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

604
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:21,442
but she didn't.

605
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:23,444
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

606
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:25,154
- All right, calm down!
- No!

607
00:41:25,237 --> 00:41:27,031
She used us, all of us!

608
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:29,492
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

609
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:30,785
Food and a bed.

610
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,079
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

611
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,164
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

612
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:37,541
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

613
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,086
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

614
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:42,213
She knows where Will is,

615
00:41:42,296 --> 00:41:45,091
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

616
00:41:45,174 --> 00:41:47,635
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

617
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,761
Shut up.

618
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:51,305
We're looking for some stupid monster...

619
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:55,601
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

620
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,020
I said shut up!

621
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,565
- Stop!
- Knock it off, you idiots.

622
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:02,983
- Stop it!
- Mike, get off!

623
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,985
Stop it!

624
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:11,450
Jesus!

625
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:16,330
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

626
00:42:16,414 --> 00:42:18,165
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

627
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,334
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- Come on, Lucas!

628
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:22,086
Why would you do that?

629
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,547
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

630
00:42:25,464 --> 00:42:27,842
What is wrong with you?

631
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:43,000
What is that?

632
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,419
I have no idea.

633
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,313
Help! Help!

634
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:08,234
Come on, wake up.
Come on!

635
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:11,237
Lucas...
Lucas, come on!

636
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:16,408
Lucas.

637
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:18,577
Lucas, you okay?

638
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:22,748
Lucas... Lucas,
how many fingers am I holding up?

639
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:24,208
Lucas, how many fingers?

640
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,293
- Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

641
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:28,796
Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.

642
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:30,172
Get off of me!

643
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,301
- Lucas, come on.
- Let him go.

644
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,597
Man, let him go.

645
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:44,937
Where is El?

646
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:48,190
El?

647
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,568
- El!
- Eleven!

648
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:53,487
El!

649
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:56,574
- Eleven!
- El!

650
00:44:57,741 --> 00:44:58,868
Eleven!

651
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:25,227
What, are you tired?

652
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:26,770
Shut up.

653
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:27,897
What?

654
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:33,027
I heard something.

655
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,382
Oh, God.

656
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:04,850
It's been hit by a car.

657
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:12,566
We can't just leave it.

658
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:29,625
I'll do it.

659
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,171
- I thought you said...
- I'm not nine anymore.

660
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:04,410
What was that?

661
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,359
Where'd it go?

662
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,487
I don't know.

663
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:44,533
Do you see any more blood?

664
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:47,077
No.

665
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:34,917
Jonathan?

666
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:11,388
Nancy!

667
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,437
Nancy?

668
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:21,106
Nancy?

669
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:23,734
Nancy, where are you?

670
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:27,446
Nancy!

671
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,990
Nancy!
